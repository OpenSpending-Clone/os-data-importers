Managing authority: 

- beginning is made for the code lists

Under the auspices of the EU's cohesion policy for 2014-20, a managing authority is responsible for the efficient management and implementation of an operational programme.
A managing authority may be a national ministry, a regional authority, a local council, or another public or private body that has been nominated and approved by a Member State. Managing authorities are expected to conduct their work in line with the principles of sound financial management.
For each operational programme, a managing authority must provide the Commission with an annual implementation report by 31 May each year. Other key tasks for a managing authority include:
• ensuring that activities selected for funding match the operational programme's criteria
• checking that co-financed products and services are delivered efficiently according to EU and national rules
• recording and storing accounts, and ensuring that a rigorous audit trail exists
• ensuring that an operational programme's performance is properly evaluated

Certifying authority

A certifying authority is responsible for guaranteeing the accuracy and probity of statements of expenditure and requests for payments before they are sent to the European Commission. Management of the European Regional Development Fund, European Social Fund and Cohesion Fund is shared with member countries, regions and other intermediary bodies. A certifying authority is nominated by one or more of the aforementioned groups for each operational programme co-financed by these Funds.
Specific responsibilities of certifying authorities include:
• Certifying compatibility of expenditure with national and EU rules and criteria
• Ensuring sufficient information is received from the relevant Managing Authorities to support their claims
• Taking account of audit reports
• Maintaining computerised records
• Keeping account of unused/recovered funds to be returned to the Commission


Operational programme

Operational programmes are detailed plans in which the Member States set out how money from the European Structural and Investment Funds (ESIF) will be spent during the programming period. They can be drawn up for a specific region or a country-wide thematic goal (e.g. Environment). For the European Territorial Cooperation goal, cross-border or interregional operational programmes are drawn up.
Member States submit their operational programmes on the basis of their Partnership Agreements. Each operational programme specifies which of the 11 thematic objectives that guide cohesion policy in the 2014-20 programming period will be addressed through the funding available under the operational programmes.


Thematic objectives

In the 2014-2020 programming period, the European Structural and Investment Funds, in particular the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), the European Social Fund (ESF) and the Cohesion Fund, will support 11 investment priorities, also known as thematic objectives:
1. Strengthening research, technological development and innovation
2. Enhancing access to, and use and quality of information and communication technologies (ICT)
3. Enhancing the competitiveness of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)
4. Supporting the shift towards a low-carbon economy in all sectors
5. Promoting climate change adaptation, risk prevention and management
6. Preserving and protecting the environment and promoting resource efficiency
7. Promoting sustainable transport and removing bottlenecks in key network infrastructures
8. Promoting sustainable and quality employment and supporting labour mobility
9. Promoting social inclusion, combating poverty and any discrimination
10. Investing in education, training and vocational training for skills and lifelong learning
11. Enhancing institutional capacity of public authorities and stakeholders and efficient public administration
At the same time, the first four of these thematic objectives constitute key priorities for the ERDF, and a significant part of the investment will focus on these areas (between 50% and 80%, depending on the region’s level of development).
The goal of these objectives is to focus regional policy funding on areas that deliver the highest benefits to citizens, creating synergies between the funded projects and avoiding an excessive fragmentation of funding.


Regional Policy and the Commission's political priorities
Regional Policy has a strong impact in many fields. Its investments help to deliver many EU policy objectives and complements EU policies such as those dealing with education, employment, energy, the environment, the single market, research and innovation.
The European Structural and Investment Funds are directly contributing to the Investment Plan and the Commission's priorities.
Regional Policy provides the necessary investment framework to meet the goals of the Europe 2020 Strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth in the European Union.
The five targets for the EU in 2020 are:
* Employment: 75%of the 20-64 year-olds to be employed
* Research & Development: 3% of the EU's GDP to be invested in R&D
* Climate change and energy sustainability:
    * 		Greenhouse gas emissions 20% (or even 30%, if the conditions are right)
    * 		20% of energy from renewables
    * 		20 % increase of energy efficiency
* Education:
    * 		Reducing the rates of early school leavers below 10%
    * 		At least 20 million fewer people in or at risk of poverty and social exclusion
* Fighting poverty and social exclusion: At least 20 million fewer people in or at risk of poverty and social exclusion
Each Member State has adopted its own national targets in these areas.
