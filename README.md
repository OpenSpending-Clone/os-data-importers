# OS-Data-Importers

## Goal

The aim of this project is to keep the data in OpenSpending as fresh as possible, by proactively fetching up-to-date 
fiscal data from various data-portals and other official sources. By linking the data in OpenSpending to the exact 
source, we also gain more credibility to the data stored in the platform.

## Means

We use the `datapackage-pipelines` framework to run the processing pipelines.
