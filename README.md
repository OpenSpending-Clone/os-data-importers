# OS-Data-Importers

## Goal

The aim of this project is to keep the data in OpenSpending as fresh as possible, by pro-actively fetching up-to-date fiscal data from various data-portals and other official sources. By linking the data in OpenSpending to the exact source, we also gain more credibility to the data stored in the platform.

## Means

We use the `datapackage-pipelines` framework to run the processing pipelines.

## Update a datapackage with a `fiscal.source-spec.yaml`

To update a datapackage on OpenSpending, either because the source-spec has changed, or because the data itself has been updated, you must make a change to the `fiscal.source-spec.yaml` file and commit it to the master branch of this repository. If only the data has changed, but not the source-spec, the easiest change to make is to increment the source-spec's `revision` property.

## Current Status

#### Mexico 2008-2016 Budget (Cuenta PÃºblica): [Pipeline](https://openspending.org/pipelines/)

## Development notes

The env var `$OS_DPP_DISABLE_PIPELINES='True'` will prevent pipeline schedulers from being initialised. This is useful if you want to retain the pipeline server endpoint for your application, but not run the actual pipelines (e.g. for a staging server).
